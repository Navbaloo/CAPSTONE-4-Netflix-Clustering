# CAPSTONE-4-Netflix-Clustering
Unsupervised ML
This dataset consists of TV shoes and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service's number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset. Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can be also provide many interesting findings.


Objective - Our objective is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis to understand what content is available in different countries and if Netflix has been increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years. And use these insights to cluster similar content by matching text-based features
